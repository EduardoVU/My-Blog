In this essay, I will talk about my work during the third week, that mainly consists of an advance in homework, studying a new programming language, and teamwork skills.

First, I worked on two tasks, one of them was in team. Therefore, we had an online meeting with the teammates, where we agreed on the work that each one was responsible for.

Additionally, I had to learn a new programming language. I realized that most programming languages are similar to each other. In particular, I had an issue with the SDK file to code in one of the languages, it took me some time, but at the end of the day the problem was overcame thus I was able to advance on my part of the work. With this, in particular, I might be able to apply it to every programming language in the near future. Also, I am grateful that my team helped me when I was in trouble with the homework.

After, I continued working with the individual homework and learned that are two ways to solve a problem; the first is by force and the second is solving it by a "smarter" way. Coding using the "smart way" is much easier to say it than doing it, but it helps to save process time. For this reason, I studied data structures deeper to optimize the code. 

Furthermore, I also learned the importance of taking breaks, because when I felt overwhelmed I couldn't think well in optimal solutions, but after doing something else like a walk in the park or playing with my pets, once I retook the task I worked in a better mood and also solve the problem in an efficient way.
