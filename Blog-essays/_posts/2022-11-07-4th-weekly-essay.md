In this essay, I will discuss my work during the sixth week in the apprentice program. The principal subject in this essay is what I have done in the project.

After almost finishing the course in java fundamentals and taking the advice of the staff members, I started to code the CRUD of the API. The fun part of this, when they recommended me, I didn’t know what is a CRUD or even an API. For this reason, I had to do a little research to start coding.

Even when I planned to study “React” before “Spring”, different people advised me to start with “Spring” before “React”, and that is what I did. I created a project with “Spring”.
I made the model using the shortcuts of “IntelliJ IDEA” to create the setters and getters. Also, I used a hashmap as a memory with the ID of the class and the class.

Something new that I learned during the week, is the use of interfaces, and how to create and implement them. This is important for me because I wasn’t involved with Object Oriented Programming, at least, right now I have an idea of how to work with it.

Summing up, this week I focused mainly on continuing with the courses and creating the API of the project.
