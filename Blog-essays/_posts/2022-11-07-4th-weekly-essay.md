In this essay, I will discuss my work during the sixth week in the apprentice program. The principal subject in this essay is what I have done in the project.


After almost finishing the course in java fundamentals and taking the advice of the staff members, I started to code the CRUD of the API. The fun part of this, when they recommended me, I didn’t know what is a CRUD or even an API. For this reason, I had to do a little research to start coding.


Even when I planned to study “React” before “Spring”, different people advised me to start with “Spring” before “React”, and that is what I did. I created a project with “Spring”.


Summing up, this week I focused mainly on continuing with the courses and creating the API of the project.
