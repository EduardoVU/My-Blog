In this essay I will talk about my work during the fifth week in the apprentice program. The principal subject in this essay is what I named “the project”.

The apprentice’s members received an activity with a due date for almost a month. This is great because it is a really demanding project and to complete it, I have to learn a lot of things, because this project is something new to me, from the beginning to the end of it. For that reason I started some recommended courses from part of the staff, where I’m learning the fundamentals of Java. While I was doing this course I also dedicated some time to my work environment, for example, installing different IDE’s.

After finishing the “Java” course I am planning to continue with the next one, a course dedicated to “React” and finishing with a course that can teach me “Spring”.

Additionally, I have the intention to contact some of Encora's developers in order to receive support and advice to fulfill all the requirements in this project. Moreover, I finished a compliance course about the export control’s sanctions.

Summing up, this week I focused mainly on learning new things and preparing everything to advance “the project”.
